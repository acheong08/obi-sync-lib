# UNFINISHED AND UNMAINTAINED

Obsidian is not open source and their team has been openly hostile towards our efforts at self hosting the sync server. I am currently using [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and [syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/) for note taking.
There are no plans to complete this project.
